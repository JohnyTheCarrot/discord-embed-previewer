# Privacy Policy

I do not in any way send anything the extension on your computer sees to any server.
This means that my extension does not make any connection to any external service
aside from the website you are visiting itself, for the purpose of showing embed imagery, if present.
For the purpose of showing the dummy Discord user's avatar, I make a request to Discord's Content Delivery Network, to retrieve the avatar.
My extension scans the website's metadata to build the embed.
This carries no additional risk than just visiting the site without my extension.
